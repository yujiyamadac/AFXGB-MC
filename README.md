This is the implementation of the AFXGB-MC as described in our paper:

> Fabiano Baldo, Julia Grando, Yuji Yamada Correa and Deividy Amorim Policarpo “Adaptive Fast XGBoost for Multiclass Classification”. In: JIDM 2023.

This implementation is written in Python 3 and built on top of 
[scikit-multiflow](https://github.com/scikit-multiflow/scikit-multiflow).

To run the example:

```shell
python caller_example.py
```
